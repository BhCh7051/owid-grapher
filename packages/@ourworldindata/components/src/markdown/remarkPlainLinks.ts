import findAndReplace from "mdast-util-find-and-replace"

// This regex matches:
//   "http"
//   an optional "s"
//   two / characters
//   The subdomains and hostname: Any word or numeric character or "_" or "-" one or more times followed by a period
//   The TLD: Any word or numeric character or "_" or "-" one or more times
//   The path, query string and fragment: A forward slash followed by any word or numeric character (unicode classes so umlauts like รถ match
//       as well as any of the following: .+?:%&=~#) zero or more times. Note that we exclude space even though that is valid in a URL but it tends
//       to make the match too greedy.
//   Note that this URL will tend to match too much at the end - if there is a URL at the end of a sentence, the period will
//   be matched by the regex. We accept this and handle it below when we create the link.
//   This URL could be made to not match trailing characters like .?: but AFAIK this requires a negative lookbehind which are not supported in
//   Safari before 16.4 which came out in Spring 2023
